# Machine-Learning-Python
Journey towards Machine Learning Mastery!
---

This repository contains the various deep learning models that were developed while learning Machine Learning.
The models created are based on Theano and Tensorflow backend and uses Keras.

Lesson 1: Simple calculation using basic Tensorflow functions

Lesson 2: Creating a model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, with a validation split of 0.33

Lesson 3: Creating a model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, using 'StratifiedKFold' class to perform K-fold cross validation

Lesson 4: Using 'KerasClassifier' wrapper to create model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset

Lesson 5: Performing Grid Search to evaluate different configurations for the neural network. Model works on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset

Lesson 6: Creating a fully connected network for the famous Iris flower multiclass classification problem. One hot encoding is performed to encode class values as integers

Lesson 7: A fully connected network is created for the Sonar Object Classification problem

Lesson 8: Perform standardization on the data before building the network. A pipeline is created to standardize the data in each pass of the cross validation instead of standardizing the entire dataset

Lesson 9: Tuning the network by experimenting with different network structures. A smaller network with fewer neurons in the first hidden layer, as well as a larger network with an additional hidden layer are created and tested.

Lesson 10: Compared three neural network structures on Boston House Prices Regression problem - the baseline model, a larger model with more hidden layers, and a wider model with more neurons in the hidden layer
