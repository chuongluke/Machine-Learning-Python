# Machine-Learning-Python
Journey towards Machine Learning Mastery!

This repository contains the various deep learning models that were developed while learning Machine Learning.
The models created are based on Theano and Tensorflow backend and uses Keras.

Lesson 1: Simple calculation using basic Tensorflow functions
Lesson 2: Creating a model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, with a validation split of 0.33
Lesson 3: Creating a model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, using 'StratifiedKFold' class to perform K-fold cross validation
Lesson 4: Using 'KerasClassifier' wrapper to create model on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset
Lesson 5: Performing Grid Search to evaluate different configurations for the neural network. Model works on Pima Indian Diabetes dataset
Lesson 6: Creating a fully connected network for the famous Iris flower multiclass classification problem. One hot encoding is performed to encode class values as integers
Lesson 7: A fully connected network is created for the Sonar Object Classification problem
